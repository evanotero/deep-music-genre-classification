# Deep Music Genre Classification
Using deep learning to categorize music as time progresses through dpectrogram snalysis.


## About
Our aim is to create a neural network (CNN + LSTM RNN) that recognizes music genre and provides a user-friendly visualization for the network's current belief of the genre of a song.

This project uses Keras, using TensorFlow for the backend, for the neural network and Tornado for serving requests.


## Background
The rationale for this particular model is based on several works, primarily [Grzegorz Gwardys and Daniel Grzywczak, Deep Image Features in Music Information Retrieval](http://ijet.pl/index.php/ijet/article/view/10.2478-eletel-2014-0042/53), [Recommending music on Spotify with Deep Learning](http://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html), and [Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network for Live Music Genre Recognition](http://deepsound.io/music_genre_recognition.html).
